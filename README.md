# Pacsat
This is an Open source implementation of the Pacsat protocol based on public documents.  Designed to run on a Linux computer using Direwolf as the TNC.  
For those interested I have a list of the Pacsat Protocol documents on this page: https://www.g0kla.com/pacsat/index.php

This is dependant on https://github.com/ac2cz/iors_common

To build this, clone the repository then cd into the Debug folder

You can use:  make all to build everything, or make clean to remove all the compiled objects.

Follow the instructions to setup direwolf from https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/blob/master/doc/

Create a file called pacsat.config in the directory where you run this.  Here are some default contents:
```
# Changing the bitrate here does not change the rate of the TNC.  Also
# update the TNC configuration
bit_rate=1200
# Callsigns
bbs_callsign=XY2ZZ-12
broadcast_callsign=XY2ZZ-11
digi_callsign=XY2ZZ-1
# If a lot of frames are queued by the tnc then broadcast confirms can
# feel slugish.  Keep this value low.
max_frames_in_tx_buffer=2
```

To run the program start direwolf in one terminal and then run Pacsat in another.  It should connect to the direwolf AGW engine to send and receive packets.
To run pi_pacsat you need to have a library path for the library.  Run this first:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/usb-disk/ariss/lib:/usr/local/lib/iors_common:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Then you need to pass it some switches:
pi_pacsat -h will show you what they are.
You need to tell it where the data will be saved and where the config file is.  So something like:
```
./pi_pacsat -c ~/pacsat.cfg -d ~/pacsat_data
```
This supports broadcast requests, transmissions and file uploads.
